# 136. Single Number

4 1 2 1 2
```
array = new int [len(nums)]

for nums :  
    arra[num]++;

for array: 
    if array == 1   
        return index;
```
using array doesnot satisfied all the test cause it might have contais the negative or num more than the len

so we can use the map to store the element and we can itratre the map to find the number occures once.
